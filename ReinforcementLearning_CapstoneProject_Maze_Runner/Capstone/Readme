Domain Background
In the micromouse project a robot mouse is attempting to find the fastest way from a corner to the center of the maze. 
The maze is unfamiliar 16x16 grid maze. 
The micromouse is starting in a certain corner of the maze and needs to navigate to a goal that is located near the center. 
In a first run the mouse maps out the maze in order to find the center. 
In the following runs the mouse will figure out the best paths to the center and look for the fastest route to the goal area. 
In this project the micromouse will navigate through a virtual maze. 
The goal is to obtain the fastest time possible in a series of test runs.
